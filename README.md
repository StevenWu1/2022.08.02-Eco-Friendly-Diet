This is my summer project that aims to recommend sustainable diets for reducing CO2 emission. 
Food production and agriculture industry contribute significantly to annual greenhouse emission. Recent research efforts focus on optimization of diet towards minimizing CO2 emission. Plant-based food and fish commonly appear in their minimized diets and tend to supply sufficient nutrients. Although these recommendations are consistent with the recent advocating for improving the sustainability of diets in high-income countries, the limitation of these efforts is obvious. They fail to consider peopleâ€™s cuisine tradition and food preference. 


I tried to find a more realistic dietary solution by replacing beef with chicken in a gradual way.
