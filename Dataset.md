In this study, I collected four datasets including food category, CO2 emission of food production, food consumption and 
nutrient availability as well as US population dataset. 

** 1. Food category **
Food products were selected and grouped based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines (2010) and the more detailed Harvard University Healthy Eating Plate (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/) food groups. 
In this analysis we consider both animal products (chicken, pigmeat, beef, fish and other aquatic foods (seafood), eggs, milk and cheese) and vegetable products (wheat, rice, fruits, pulses, starchy roots, vegetables and nuts).
