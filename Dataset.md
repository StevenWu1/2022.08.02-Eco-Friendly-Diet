In this study, I collected four datasets including food category, CO2 emission of food production, food consumption and 
nutrient availability as well as US population dataset. 

**1. Food category**


Food products were selected and grouped based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines (2010) and the more detailed Harvard University Healthy Eating Plate (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/) food groups. 
In this analysis we consider both animal products (chicken, pigmeat, beef, fish and other aquatic foods (seafood), eggs, milk and cheese) and vegetable products (wheat, rice, fruits, pulses, starchy roots, vegetables and nuts). 


**2.CO2 emission of food production**

We used four footprint indicators to analyze the environmental impacts of the production of these foods; the carbon footprint (greenhouse gas emissions), nitrogen footprint (pollution), water footprint (blue and green water use), and land footprint (land use). 
Each footprint details a different aspect of the environmental impacts of food production and together are able to portray a more complete picture of how different food products impact the environment (Leach et al., in revision).


**3.Food Consumption and Nutrient Availability dataset**


The USDA, Economic Research Service (ERS) Food Availability (Per Capita) Data System (FADS) includes three distinct but related data series on food and nutrient availability for consumption: food availability data, loss-adjusted food availability data, and nutrient availability data. 
The data serve as proxies for actual consumption at the national level. The food availability data series serves as the foundation for the other two series. Loss-adjusted food availability data (LAFA) are derived from food availability data by adjusting for food spoilage, plate waste, and other losses to more closely approximate actual consumption. This second data series is considered preliminary because the underlying food loss assumptions and estimates require further improvement. The nutrient availability data series calculates the daily food energy and 27 nutrients/dietary components of the U.S. food supply.
The food availability data include estimates for more than 200 commodities, including: individual fruits, vegetables, grains, added sugars & sweeteners, dairy products, nuts, meat, poultry, and seafood.


**4.US population dataset**
